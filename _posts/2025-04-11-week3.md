# Task Completed: Model Selection - CNN Architecture

During this week, focus was shifted to the selection of an appropriate deep learning model for deepfake image classification. After comparative analysis of various architectures, **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** were chosen due to their efficiency in spatial feature extraction from images.

## Models Evaluated:

- **VGG16**: Simple and effective but relatively heavy in terms of parameters.
- **ResNet50**: Introduced residual connections to solve vanishing gradient problems in deep networks.
- **EfficientNetB0**: Lightweight and high-performing; considered for later optimization.

## Final Model Chosen:

Initially, **ResNet50** was selected for transfer learning because of its balance between performance and computational efficiency. It allowed us to leverage pre-trained **ImageNet** weights while fine-tuning on our specific deepfake dataset.
