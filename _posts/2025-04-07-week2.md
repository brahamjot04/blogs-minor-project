# Task Completed: Dataset Collection and Preprocessing

The second week was dedicated to the collection and preprocessing of datasets for training the deep learning model. The datasets collected included:

- **FaceForensics++**
- **DeepFake Detection Challenge (DFDC)**
- **Celeb-DF v2**
- **Kaggle Deepfake Datasets** (various open-source collections)

These datasets include both real and manipulated facial images, which are crucial for binary classification tasks (real vs. fake).

## Preprocessing Steps Involved:

- **Resizing Images** to a standard input size (e.g., 224x224 pixels) compatible with CNN architectures.
- **Normalization** of pixel values to bring them into a consistent range (0â€“1).
- **Augmentation Techniques** such as flipping, rotating, zooming, and color jittering were applied to artificially expand the dataset and reduce overfitting.
- **Class Balancing** was considered to ensure equal representation of real and fake images, helping in better model generalization.

All preprocessing steps were implemented using Python libraries such as **OpenCV** and **TensorFlow/Keras** preprocessing modules.
