# Task Completed: System Interface Design

With the core model in place, the next step was to make the system accessible to end-users. A basic yet functional user interface was developed to allow image uploads and verification.

## Key Features Implemented:

- **Image Upload Functionality**: Users can upload images through the interface.
- **Model Integration**: Uploaded images are processed and passed to the trained model for classification (Real or Fake).
- **Result Display**: Classification result is displayed along with a confidence score.
- **Backend**: Implemented using **Flask** (Python micro web framework).
- **Frontend**: Simple **HTML/CSS** interface for usability and quick testing.

This interface can serve as a prototype for future deployment in a web application or forensic software.
