# Project Environment Update: Migration to Debian for Improved Execution

**Summary of Environment Shift**
During this week, the project environment was successfully migrated to Debian OS from the previously used operating system. This change was made to address certain compatibility and performance-related issues and to simplify the setup process for key components used in the project. 

**Reason for Migration**
The decision to shift to Debian was based on the following observations:
- Improved compatibility with open-source machine learning libraries and tools 
- Easier installation of essential packages such as Python, OpenCV, and Flask 
- Better support for community-driven tools that can be used in the project

These factors contributed to a smoother and more predictable development workflow. 

**Implementation Overview**
- Reconfigured project dependencies including Python, Flask, TensorFlow, and OpenCV
- Ensured compatibility of Error Level Analysis (ELA), metadata analysis, and MLP models
- Validated system performance and stability across all modules
