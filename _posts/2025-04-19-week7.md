# Prototype Development Update: Initial Model Exhibits False Positives 
**Overview**
This week, we successfully developed the first working prototype of our deepfake detection system. The application integrates a user-friendly frontend with a functional backend to accept images and predict their authenticity. 

The prototype uses the following tech stack: 
- Frontend: HTML/CSS with Bootstrap for responsive design 
- Backend: Flask (Python) for server-side logic 
- Model: Neural network built using Keras 
- Dataset: A combination of real and deepfake images from publicly available datasets 

**Prototype Features**
- Upload interface for image input 
- Preprocessing using Error Level Analysis (ELA) 
- Inference via a trained Keras-based neural network model 
- Result display with classification label (Real or Fake) and confidence score 

**Observed Issue: False Positives**
During testing, we observed that the prototype incorrectly classified some genuine images as fake, resulting in false positives. This misclassification indicates that the model might be:
- Overfitting to certain compression patterns present in the training dataset 
- Not generalizing well to unseen image types or resolutions 
- Sensitive to variations in lighting, camera type, or file metadata 

**Planned Remediation Steps**
To address this issue, the following actions are planned:
- Dataset Augmentation: Expand the dataset with more diverse and high-resolution real images 
- Model Tuning: Apply regularization techniques, and re-evaluate the model architecture 
- Threshold Adjustment: Fine-tune the confidence threshold for classification
