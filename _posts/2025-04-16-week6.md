# Research Material for Minor Project: Deepfake Detection using Machine Learning
**Introduction**
This blog presents the complete research and methodology behind our minor project focused on detecting deepfakes using ML and neural networks. Our approach combines image forensics, metadata analysis, and layered video detection to uncover digital manipulation in both images and videos.Shape 

**Image Forensics with ELA (Error Level Analysis)** <br>
ELA (Error Level Analysis) is a compression-based method that exposes tampered regions in an image by identifying inconsistencies in JPEG compression. 

**Working Process:** 
- Resave the image at 90% quality (introduces uniform compression). 
- Compare the resaved image with the original. 
- Detect anomalies in compression levels across the image. 

**Why ELA Works:** 
- Edited regions compress differently than untouched ones. 
- These are visualized through highlighted error level differences. 
- Helps isolate areas of manipulation effectively. 

**Metadata & MLP-Based Classification**
In addition to ELA, we used image metadata (EXIF) and a Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) to classify images. 

**Key Steps:**
- Extract metadata (device info, software, timestamps). 
- Preprocess ELA and metadata into feature vectors. 
- Train MLP to output a probability score for tampering likelihood. 
This hybrid model increases accuracy by combining visual and non-visual signals. 

**Multi-Level Video Deepfake Detection**
Our project also explores asyntactic detection in videos, structured in three levels: 
| Detection Level| Indicators      | Classifier Type                                   |
|----------------|--------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| Physical Level | Blinks, lighting, motion blur | Weak Classifier (SVM) |
| Semantic Level | Lip sync, frame transition inconsistency |   Strong Classifier (CNN) |
| Physiological Level | Facial tension, micro-expressions  | MLP with context score    |
