# Project Environment Update: Shift to Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL 9)

**Summary of Environment Shift**
To improve system compatibility and execution efficiency, the project environment has been migrated from Debian OS to Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL 9).

**Reason for Migration**
During the initial setup and development phase on Debian, multiple system-level challenges were encountered, including:

- Inconsistencies during dependency management.
- Conflicts between Python packages critical for machine learning workflows.
- Challenges in configuring systemd services and SELinux policies for our Flask-based backend.
- Installation and integration issues with Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS) and other Big Data tools.

These issues impacted both development speed and reliability, prompting the shift to a more stable platform.

**Implementation Steps**

- Reinstalled the dependencies from venv
- Verified the execution of core modules such as Error Level Analysis (ELA), metadata processing, and neural network training pipelines
