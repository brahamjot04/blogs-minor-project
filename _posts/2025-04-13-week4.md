# Task Completed: Model Training and Transfer Learning

This week was focused on training the selected CNN model using the collected and preprocessed datasets. The process involved:

## Data Splitting:
- The dataset was divided into:
  - **Training**: 70%
  - **Validation**: 15%
  - **Testing**: 15%

## Transfer Learning:
- Used pre-trained **ResNet50** weights.
- Fine-tuned the final layers for our specific deepfake classification task.

## Training Parameters:
- **Learning Rate**: 0.0001  
- **Optimizer**: Adam  
- **Loss Function**: Binary Cross-Entropy  
- **Epochs**: 20 (initial testing)  
- **Batch Size**: 32  

The model was trained using **TensorFlow/Keras**, and training progress was monitored through **loss** and **accuracy** metrics.  
**Early stopping** and **model checkpointing** techniques were applied to avoid overfitting and preserve the best-performing model.

The training results showed encouraging performance, with **accuracy reaching above 90%** on the validation dataset after tuning.
